//In T20 IPL, a player name is considered as lucky based on some constraints.
// 
//Check whether the player name is set as per the following Validation Rule :
//1. The player name is a string, it should have alphabet 'a' only at odd occurrences It is valid only when 
//the player name is in this format. 
//If the alphabet 'a' is not present in the whole string also it is valid only.
// 
//2. If it present in even occurrence, the output must be invalid.
// 
//Note: The starting index of the string is 1.
// 
//Include a class UserMainCode with a static method validatePlayer which accepts a string. In this method check whether the given player name is valid as per the validation rules mentioned above. The return type is Boolean.
// 
// Create a Class Main which would be used to accept the string and call the static method present in UserMainCode.
//Input and Output Format:
//Input consists of a string.
// 
//The output consists of a string “Valid” or “Invalid”.
//Refer sample output for formatting specifications.
// 
//Sample Input 1:
//Albie Morkel
//Sample Output 1:
//Valid
//Sample Input 2:
//Suresh Raina
//Sample Output 2:
//Invalid
